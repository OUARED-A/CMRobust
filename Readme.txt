A Framework for Building Robust Database Cost Models
Description
A major challenge for many database management tasks including admission control, query scheduling, progress monitoring and self-driving data storage systems is to enhance queries performances. This latter is based on computational models known as analysis cost models. One of the most challenging aspects of developing an accurate database cost models is identifying the parameters and capturing its non-linear relationships that potentially lead to the cost of specific query, database and platform characteris. Furthermore, the highly dynamic query workloads and variation brought by different system states and their hardware utilization scenario (CPU, Memory, I/O) leads to performance degradation risk, witch require re-tuning/re-designing cost models by integrating the parameters brought by this dynamic and consider the setting currently used by DBMS. In this paper, we propose a framework RobustCM for building database cost model with level of robustness against parameter uncertainties. Our framework based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for replacing todayâ€™s fairly good at predicting cost model with robust cost model that guarantee high regardless of variations from system states and workload characteristics. Our findings show that RobustCM provides a robust cost model with high prediction accuracy and stable performance
