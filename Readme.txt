We have been interested in cost models design problem, the most critical step of cost models are: identify parameters, model building and evaluation. This was motivated by the large use and the complexity of physical design applications cost models. We propose using deep learning to understand how cost can be evaluating to several physical design application like optimization structure selection, deployment
database an self tuning database. We collect historical data from Oracle DBMS. Then, we implement Deep Neural Network Model called DeepCM to identify the impact factor of performance query. DeepCM detailed system by different components into learnable system parameters (e.g. characterize the environment database system and hardware platform). We analyze their performance, in terms of accuracy and generalization. Results show that DeepCM predict performance query with extremely high accuracy, 91%. However, high accuracy comes at the expense include of impact factor parameters of the cost models that the deep analysis offer by thanks to deep learning analysis that to achieve high accuracy and generalization. This work raises various avenues for future work in this area. In particular, we plan to use our framework inside Open Source DBMS like PostgreSQL in a way to facilitate the development of cost models. It is expected that this will be a contribution to the open-source world.
