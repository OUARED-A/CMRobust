Sensitivity analysis methods estimate if the results are related to the measure of the input parameters influence by focus on domain values of parameters and
interval calculation (range of variation or influences, probability distribution) to identify the key parameters. This section evaluates two important features
of RobustCM : sensitivity analysis of database parameters and effect plots for visualization. We use the dataset in our analysis/

To identify the important/unimportant parameters, we give effects of parameters results shows an effect plot based on three techniques:
   - Statistical Data Distributions Analysis: how does the possible values for an input and how often they occur.?
  -  Sensitivity analysis: what is the importance and the relative contribution of the variability in each of the inputs to the total output variability?
  -  Correlation analysis: how does variability in the inputs propagate through the model to variability in the outputs?
